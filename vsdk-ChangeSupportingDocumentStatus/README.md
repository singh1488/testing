# Vault Java SDK Sample - vsdk-helloworld

**For full reference, please refer to [Getting Started](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Getting_Started)**.

To make getting started easy, we created a sample vSDK Hello World project that demonstrates the Vault Java SDK. The trigger returns a "Hello, world" error message when a vSDK Hello World record is created within vault!

## How to import

Import as a Maven project. This will automatically pull in the required Vault Java SDK dependencies. 

For Intellij this is done by:
- File -> Open -> Navigate to project folder -> Select the 'pom.xml' file -> Open as Project

For Eclipse this is done by:
- File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> Navigate to project folder -> Select the 'pom.xml' file

## Setup

First, you need to configure your vault so the sample trigger runs smoothly. You can do this by deploying a prepackaged set of components (.vpk), or by manually creating a "vsdk_hello_world__c" object in Vault.

#### Deploying the vSDK Hello World VPK Package

1.  Log in to your vault and navigate to Admin > Deployment > Inbound Packages and click Import.
2.  Locate and select the \deploy-vpk\vsdk-helloworld-components\vsdk-helloworld-components.vpk file on your computer. Vault opens and displays the details for the package.  
3.  From the Actions menu, select Review & Deploy. Vault displays a list of all components in the package.
4.  Click Next.   
5.  On the confirmation page, review and click Finish. You will receive an email when Vault completes the deployment.


## How to run

1.  Log into your Vault: [https://login.veevavault.com/](https://login.veevavault.com/)
2.  Start the [Vault Java SDK Debugger](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Debug_Setup).
3.  Go to  **Admin -> Business Admin**  tab and click on  **vSDK Hello World**  in the left navigation panel
4.  Click the  **Create**  button in the list page
5.  Enter your name in the  **Name**  field
6.  Click  **Save**  and you should see a "Hello, world." error in a dialog box.  
7.  Stop Running the project.

Thatâ€™s your trigger in action! 

Changes made to the code can be deployed using the [Vault Java SDK Maven plugin](https://github.com/veeva/vaultjavasdk-maven-plugin). There are sample settings files for the maven plugin in the /src/main/resources/ directory.
